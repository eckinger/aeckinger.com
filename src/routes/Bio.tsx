                    In June 2025, I graduate from the University of Chicago with a
                    degree in computer science. I'm returning home to the SF bay
                    and, at least for the summer, working for an energy startup.

                    In my free time, I love to rock climb, slackline, write in cursive,
                    read, and hang out with my friends. I've recently made
                    my 2012 kid self proud and rekindled my love for the SF Giants,
                    so I'd like to go to many games this summer (hopefully SJ Giants
                    games too).

                    This website is my latest projectâ€“it's hosted on my raspberry pi ðŸ¥°
                    and written by me. On the to-do list is a dynamic photography
                    portfolio to show off my cool photos and a blog if I feel writing
                    publicly. I actually had written this whole website, with a functioning photography portfolio, in Haskell/IHP.
                    But I couldn't get it to deploy it on the rpi :(. I grew more committed
                    to the idea of deploying on bare metal, so I decided to redo it all in
                    react/js. So let it be known this is a WIP.
