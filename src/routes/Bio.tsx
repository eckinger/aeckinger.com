                    In June 2025, I graduate from the University of Chicago with a
                    degree in computer science. I'm returning home to the SF bay
                    and, at least for the summer, working for an energy startup.

                    In my free time, I love to rock climb, slackline, write in cursive,
                    read, and hang out with my friends. I've recently made
                    my 2012 kid self proud and rekindled my love for the SF Giants,
                    so I'd like to go to many games this summer (hopefully SJ Giants
                    games too).

                    This website is hosted on my raspberry pi ðŸ¥° and written by me.
                    I actually had written this whole website, with a functioning photography portfolio, in Haskell/IHP.
                    After failing to deploy on the rpi, I decided to redo it all in
                    react/js. So let it be known this is a WIP.
